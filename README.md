# Applitools Hackathon 2019

This project represents a complete submission for the [Applitools Visual AI Rockstar Hackathon](https://applitools.com/hackathon).

## Tools

**Applitools** is an amazing tool that allows you to find visual differences between screenshots of an application. At some point you will set a *baseline*, or expected image, for a particular view. On future test runs, you'll compare *checkpoints* against the baseline.

You can find out more about Applitools [here](https://applitools.com/).

**Cypress** is the greatest end-to-end testing framework for web applications that I've used. Period. It's easy to configure, executes quickly, and gives you complete control over the application running in the browser.

## The Contest

The purpose of the hackathon is to spread the word about all the benefits Applitools can provide to existing testing frameworks. I've listed a few benefits I've seen from Applitools below:

- **Applitools lets you test the application like a user.** Functional tests are an extremely important part of the pipeline but they generally involve much greater information about the system that the user will never have. There can be a bit of a disconnect and Applitools allows you to design tests with no more information than what the user can see. A change may occur in the code that alters a view but doesn't break any tests. Applitools will pick up on the change.

- **Applitools can quickly be integrated with existing test frameworks.** This project involves a combination of Applitools and Cypress which happened easily with around 3 terminal commands and a few lines of code.

- **Applitools creates a common ground for Quality Engineers, Software Developers, and Business Owners.** While it can be hard communicating the details of unfamiliar frameworks, Applitools lets you visually point out the issues and quickly identify solutions.
